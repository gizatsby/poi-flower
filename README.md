# poi-flower
Python 3.6.4 code to create a poi flower visualization that can be saved as a gif or video.
Based on this thing I made in Desmos: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/kprvyeet14

Requirements:

* Python 3
* numpy
* matplotlib

I'd recommended that you have python.exe added to your system path as well as whatever folder you put the code in.
If you have your own way of executing python apps, go ahead.

Usage:

Once you execute the program, it'll walk you through the setup step-by-step. Here's an example:

**C:\something>** poi_flower.py

**Enter the spinning frequency (integer, negative is anti-spin)** -2

**Enter the length of the inner radius (the "arm")** 1.1

**Enter the length of the outer radius (the "poi")** 0.9

**Enter the number of loops before clearing the trail** 2

**Show Circles? (Y/N)** no
